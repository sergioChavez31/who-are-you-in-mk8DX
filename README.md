# Who are you in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
This project is a lighthearted quiz-style website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users complete a short form, and upon submission, they are taken to a results page that reveals which Mario Kart 8 Deluxe character best matches their personality.

This project was developed as part of Georgia Techâ€™s CS 1301 course to apply introductory concepts in front-end web development, including:

- Form handling

- Basic user input processing

- Conditional rendering and page redirection
